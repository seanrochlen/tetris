# Tetris in Javascript

This is a demonstration of using Javascript without any type of library and showing the power of the programming language through the classic game Tetris.
I wanted to show that you can use classical inheritance to accomplish your tasks.
Later, I will update code documentation and refactor for modularization.

How to play the game:
---------------------
1) Download a zip of this repository and extract it on your machine
2) Drag the file index.html into your browser
3) Enjoy!
