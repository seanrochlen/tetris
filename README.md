# Tetris in Javascript

I created this game for fun in JavaScript.<br/>
There are many different ways to create the game Tetris in this programming language and this is one such example.<br/>
Later, I will update code documentation and refactor for modularization.

How to play the game:
---------------------
1) Download a zip of this repository and extract it on your machine
2) Drag the file index.html into your browser. Currently this is only meant for larger monitors on desktop. Sorry :(. It's not responsive.
3) Enjoy!


If you like this game, please send me feedback at seanrochlen@gmail.<br/>
Let me know if you would create it differently and how or improve upon it.
